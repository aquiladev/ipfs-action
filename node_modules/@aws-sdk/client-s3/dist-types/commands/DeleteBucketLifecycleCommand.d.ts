/**
 * <p>Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the
 *          lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your
 *          objects never expire, and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of
 *          rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.</p>
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
 *             <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> action. By default, the bucket owner has this
 *          permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to others.</p>
 *
 *          <p>There is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion is fully
 *          propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.</p>
 *
 *          <p>For more information about the object expiration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions">Elements to
 *             Describe Lifecycle Actions</a>.</p>
