/**
 * <p>This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
 *          request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides
 *          a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request
 *          overhead.</p>
 *
 *          <p>The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
 *          provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
 *          version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
 *          delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the
 *          response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the
 *          result as deleted.</p>
 *
 *          <p> The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
 *          action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
 *          key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
 *          action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return
 *          any information about the delete in the response body.</p>
 *
 *          <p>When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete
 *          any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
 *          request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
 *          provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the
 *          entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete"> MFA
 *          Delete</a>.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon
 *          S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in
 *          transit.</p>
